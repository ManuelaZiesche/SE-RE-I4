With that example form you see above you can fill in personal data for
each member of the StuRa. You can add multiple functions the Member belongs to
and the legislative period for that function. You can also add multiple
E-Mails for the User. You can save the new Member by clicking on the Button
"Speichern". You will then be redirected to the Member-View and your
new Member should appear in the table.
